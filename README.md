# AlgoClass
AlgorithmA generates the digits eulers number, and then finds the first occurence of a 10 digit prime number
AlgorithmB is a greedy algorithm that returns change in the fewest amount of coins. Coin values are user defined as well as the initial value
AlgorithmC is a dynamic programming solution to finding the optimal alignment between two input strings that only have characters apart of the same alphabet
